# python-api-challenge


This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy. 

Part 1: WeatherPy 

1.In this part, create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 

2.Requirements 
    1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude. 
        - a.Latitude vs. Temperature 
        - b.Latitude vs. Humidity 
        - c.Latitude vs. Cloudiness 
        - d.Latitude vs. Wind Speed. 


2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship. 
- a.You should create the following plots: 
- b.Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude 
- c.Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude 
- d.Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude 
- e.Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude 
- f.Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude 
- g.Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude 
- h.Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude 
- i.Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude 



Part 2: VacationPy 
1.Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city. 
2.Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. 
3.Create a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity. 
4.For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates. 
5.Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map.
